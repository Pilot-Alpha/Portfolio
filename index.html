        <hr>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Ahnad Aariz Enan, a 17-year-old high school student at Notre Dame College, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have a strong passion for coding, music, physics, philosophy, and aviation. Over the years, I’ve been developing my skills in HTML, CSS, and Python, and I'm always excited to learn more. Besides coding, I’m an enthusiastic debater having multiple national awards. I am also good at my academic results. I love pondering deep questions about society and life, being philosophical. Music is also one of my passions. I can play the guitar. I also participate in Physics and Math olympiads, having won divisional championships at both. And being an Avgeek, I know a thing or two about planes.
        </p>
        <h2>My goals</h2>
        <p>
            My goal now is to get a scholarship into a prestigious college abroad for higher studies in the field of Computer Science and Engineering. I am working hard to achieve that goal of mine and to be the best version of myself in both academics and extra-curricular activities. 
        </p>
        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>
            I'm still relatively new to the field of web development, but I've learned a lot. I am self-taught in web development and programming. I am proficient in HTML and CSS and have an intermediate understanding of the Python language. Right now, I aim to master front-end development by learning Javascript. After that, I want to learn the backend too by Django or Flask, ultimately becoming a fullstack developer. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have a deep passion for Machine Learning, AI, Robotics, and Mechatonics but hope to start that journey after I've reached College since I won't be able to give 100% of myself to it due to the immense pressure of studies in high school. Ultimately, I'm aiming for a Computer Science degree in College.
        </p>
        <h2>What I can offer</h2>
        <p>

I can design and code Product Landing Pages, or a portfolioI believe I have the ability to tackle advanced HTML coding and interface design with ease. I’m eager to collaborate on projects that will contribute to my personal growth while delivering high-quality results.
